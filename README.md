Today is still an ordinary day and nothing special has happened, but I am more and more worried about my future study life in the UK. The main problem is the lack of language and the high prices in the UK. Anyway, I will carry out my fat reduction plan in the UK. I still have a year to prepare. I don't know whether the time is enough, Now it seems that it has been a good year. My English level is still not very good. I'm afraid I can't understand what others say. Moreover, the computer major is such a difficult course. I don't know if I can keep up with the rhythm. It's really difficult to hone my listening, I hope I can enter one of Leeds University or Sheffield University. Thank God. The main reason is that the difficulty of this major is really great. There are so many things to learn. I hope the roommates I meet can be a little better.
